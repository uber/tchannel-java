/**
 * Represents a TChannel response message with `raw` arg scheme encoding.
 * <p>
 * All RPC frames over TChannel contain 3 opaque byte payloads, namely, arg{1,2,3}. TChannel makes no assumptions
 * about the contents of these frames. In order to make sense of these arg payloads, TChannel has the notion of
 * `arg messages` which define standardized schemas and serialization formats over the raw arg{1,2,3} payloads. The
 * supported `arg messages` are `thrift`, `json`, `http` and `sthrift`. These request / response frames will be built
 * on top of {@link RawRequest} and {@link ResponseMessage} frames.
 * <p>
 * <h3>From the Docs</h3>
 * The `raw` encoding is intended for any custom encodings you want to do that
 * are not part of TChannel but are application specific.
